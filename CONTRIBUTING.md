# Contributing Guidelines

Here are some instructions to help you with this project

## Conventional Commits

This project uses [Conventional Commit format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to automatically generate a changelog and better understand the changes in the project

Here are some examples of conventional commit messages:

- `feat: add new functionality`

## Conventional PR Titles

The title of your pull request should follow the [conventional commit format](#conventional-commits). When a pull request is merged to the main branch, all changes are going to be squashed into a single commit. The message of this commit will be the title of the pull request. And for every release, the commit messages are used to generate the changelog.
